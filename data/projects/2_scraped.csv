The need for the project is to eliminate the existing signalized intersection of SR 385 Business & SR 17 in entirety and relocate the signalization to the reconfigured four way stop intersection of SR 17 & SR 197. In the current configuration there is a distance of only 275 feet between the two intersections. By relocating the signal and eliminating the second intersection it will add to the overall operation and safety of three intersecting SR corridors at this location.

The spans of this bridge would be built to accommodate the future expansion of I-285, the typical section of which assumes 10 lanes of single occupancy vehicles (SOV) (5 in each direction) on the inside and 10 lanes of Collector-Distributor roads (5 in each direction) on the outside. A double left-turn bay is proposed for Atlanta Road eastbound to the I-285 northbound entrance ramp. The northbound entrance ramp would be realigned and modified from a single lane ramp to a two lane ramp to accommodate the left turns. A single left-turn bay is proposed for Atlanta Road westbound to the I-285 southbound entrance ramp. The southbound entrance ramp would be widened to allow for two lanes before merging to a single lane at the I-285 entrance gore. The I-285 southbound exit ramp would also be widened to accommodate dual left and right-turn movements.",54924751.54,Reconstruction/Rehabilitation,Chandria Lynnette Brown
